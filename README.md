# hello-world
First repository
My name is Paul or Pawel. 

I am very inexperienced at this stage but not for long, wait and see.
There are many projects lined up; Its is very relevant to have a working website, more to be able to code and compliment (other code). 
There are multiple modules for the Raspberry Pi system that I am interested in. They range from speech regonition, motor control, smell/grammer/temperature readings and communication analysis, accounting automation and general plug-and-play devices that currently do not work with a new "Out of box RaspPi"
